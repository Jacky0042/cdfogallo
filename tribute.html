                “His earned and decorated career, marked by exceptional humility and adherence to the ethos of patriotism and nationhood inspired all to excel in service to the public. Today, we mourn a dear friend whose firm, yet endearing spirit of family exemplified the values of justice and human dignity.”

            <h3>ADEN DUALE,CABINET SECRETARY,INTERIOR</h3>
            <p>With profound sorrow, we share the passing of Gen. Francis Omondi Ogolla, a decorated and distinguished Kenya Air Force officer who served our country for 40 years, culminating in his appointment as Chief of Defence Forces. 

                As the Cabinet Secretary in the Ministry of Defence, I had the privilege of working closely with General Ogolla, both as the Vice and Chief of Defence Forces. He was, to me, a brother first, then a friend, colleague and lastly, a General and a member of the Defense council. 
                
                His legacy will forever be cherished in our hearts and in our nation's history. 
                
                Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and those of the other officers in the ill-fated flight.
                
                Rest in peace General.</p>

            <h3>KIPCHUMBA MURKOMEN,CABINET SECRETARY,ROADS</h3>
            <p>My deepest condolences to the families and friends of Chief of Defence Forces Francis Ogolla and his officers, who died in a KDF helicopter crash earlier today.

                I also wish the two gallant soldiers who were injured in this tragic incident a quick recovery. 
                
                In the course of duty, I came to know Gen Ogolla as a man of dignity and great wisdom. On many occasions, we had consultations, especially on matters aviation. Just this February, he called on me in my office and we had an extensive conversation on the development of our aviation sector and the good work our defence forces do to defend our borders. 
                 
                May the Lord comfort his family and those of his colleagues during this difficult time.
