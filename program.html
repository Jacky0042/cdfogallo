                <h3>Jealous of the Angels</h3>
                <p>I didn't know today would be our last <br>
                    Or that I'd have to say goodbye to you so fast <br>
                    I'm so numb, I can't feel anymore <br>
                    Prayin' you'd just walk back through that door <br>
                    <p></p>
                    And tell me that I was only dreamin' <br>
                    You're not really gone as long as I believe
                    <p></p>
                    There will be another angel <br>
                    Around the throne tonight <br>
                    Your love lives on inside of me <br>
                    And I will hold on tight <br>
                    It's not my place to question <br>
                    Only God knows why <br>
                    I'm just jealous of the angels <br>
                    Around the throne tonight <br>
                    <p></p>
                    You always made my troubles feel so small <br>
                    And you were always there to catch me when I'd fall <br>
                    In a world where heroes come and go <br>
                    Well God just took the only one I know <br>
                    So I'll hold you as close as I can <br>
                    Longing for the day, when I see your face again <br>
                    But until then
                    <p></p>
                    God must need another angel <br>
                    Around the throne tonight <br>
                    Your love lives on inside of me <br>
                    And I will hold on tight <br>
                    It's not my place to question <br>
                    Only God knows why <br>
                    I'm just jealous of the angels <br>
                    Around the throne tonight <br>
                    <p></p>
                    Singin' hallelujah <br>
                    Hallelujah <br>
                    Hallelujah <br>
                    I'm just jealous of the angels <br>
                    Around the throne tonight</p>
