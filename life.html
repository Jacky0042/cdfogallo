                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>Ogolla joined the Kenya Defence Forces in 1984. He began his career as a 2nd lieutenant in the Kenyan Air Force and received training as a fighter pilot with the US Air Force. In 2018, he became Commander of the Kenya Air Force and later Vice Chief of Defence Forces. He was appointed Chief of Defence Forces by President William Ruto after the retirement of General Robert Kariuki Kibochi in April 2023. At the time, Ogolla's appointment raised controversy after the head of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission accused him of being part of a national security council delegation that tried to influence the result of the 2022 general election against the eventual winner, Ruto, who defended Ogolla citing his qualifications.

                    Ogolla studied and graduated from the École Militaire de Paris, the National Defence College of Kenya, Egerton University and the University of Nairobi. He was a recipient of several awards, including the Elder of the Order of the Golden Heart of Kenya (EGH) and Chief of the Order of the Burning Spear (CBS).</p>
